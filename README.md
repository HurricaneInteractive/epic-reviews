# Epic Reviews

A website that will allow users to submit reviews for games on the Epic Game store. This is a missing feature and something that should be there already. The site will be built with a API first approach as I plan to create a browser extension that will be available on the Epic Game store using the same data.

> The project is still VERY MUCH in progress. The plans and ideas are currently in my head. I might create some issues to make contributing to the project easier
